# About me
I am 19 years old. I am studying at university. I have the desire and ability to learn something new and I think this is the most important thing. My best 3 qualities are punctuality, responsibility and independence. Of weak qualities I am not very well-read: at school I did not like to read. But now I read different articles about programming, documentation, book about algorithms. I like to solve problems, to look for other ways to solve problems. For me, my interest has become closer to frontend development. I was and am always interested in how sites are developed, specifically the client side: what the user sees, how elements are arranged, animation using js. That's why I want to learn all the necessary skills in a company to work there. The most important thing is the desire.
